## Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard > Table editor.
2. For `incidents`, `chat_messages`, and analytics tables, enable RLS.
3. Add policies like:
   - Only allow users to read/write their own incidents/messages.
   - Only allow users with `role = 'admin'` to access analytics.

Example policy for admin:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admins can access analytics" ON analytics
FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'admin');
```

## Roles
- Assign `admin` role in Supabase Auth for users who should access `/admin/analytics`.
- Regular users get `user` or `volunteer` roles.
